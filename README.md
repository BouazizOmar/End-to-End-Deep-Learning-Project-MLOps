# End-to-End-Deep-Learning-Project-MLOps
This project is an End-to-End Deep Learning implementation to classify chest CT-scan images as either normal or having signs of adenocarcinoma cancer. The project integrates MLOps tools like MLflow and DVC for efficient version control, tracking experiments, and CICD deployment.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Classifies chest CT-scans.
MLOps Integration: Uses MLflow and DVC for experiment tracking and data versioning.
CI/CD Pipeline: Ensures smooth deployment of the model.
Web Components (Planned): Added structure for React and Django for potential future use.
Tools Used
MLflow: To track experiments and log models.
DVC: To handle large datasets and track data versions.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
React (Planned): For the frontend user interface.
Django (Planned): For the backend and API management.
